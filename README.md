# The NovaSonica Bundle

## Sonic ...

### ... Auto Pan (ns_sap)
**Version**: 1.0.1  

The name says it, it tries to automatically pan your signal. 

### ... Boom Control (ns_sbc)
**Version**: 1.0.3  

Uses a couple of tricks to allow you to boost a signal by quite a bit without applying actual compression. It does use a very little to limit the output to -0.1 dB, but not for the actual boosting. Via an XY-pad you can control the sonic character and balance the high and low end of your signal.

### ... Clean (ns_sc)
**Version**: 1.0.1  

This removes infrasound (< 20 Hz) and ultrasound (> 20 kHz) from your signal. Unless you want to make your listeners feel unwell there is no reason to keep these frequencies, filtering them increases clarity and reduces problems that appear when playing your audio through different stereo sets.

### ... Crow (ns_scr)
**Version**: 1.0.2  

Dedicated to a little crow that left the world too early.  
Probably the effect of this bundle that is the hardest to describe. In very technical terms: it makes a copy of your input and mixes it with the input after the amount of milliseconds you set. You can define how much the signal is shifted between the left and right channel and add *edge* to it which manipulates the delayed signal based on the current input. In less technical terms: it makes weird effects by messing around with a very short delay superimposed on the input signal - just give it a shot and you'll get a better idea than I can describe.   

### ... Delay Sphere (ns_sds)
**Version**: 1.0.2  

A BPM-driven delay that makes use of stereo effects and allows you to blend forward and reverse delays using an XY-pad. 

### ... Phase Control (ns_spc)
**Version**: 1.0.1  

Being able to control the phase of a signal allows you to create a wide range of effects but it also enables you to employ some simple mixing tricks. For example: a kick and a bass guitar often overlap in the low end, so you have to do extra EQing to keep them separated. With Phase Control you can achieve the same without EQing by rotating the phase a few degrees, sometimes it doesn't need more than one degree to have bass guitar and kick neatly separated.

### ... Stereo Control (ns_ssc)
**Version**: 1.0.1  

Wanna mess with your stereo signal? Well, here you go. This can be useful to widen a signal, or to add some noise to it, or to do both at once.

### ... Signal Meter (ns_ssm)
**Version**: 1.0.0  


### ... Stereo Polish (ns_ssm)
**Version**: 1.0.1
